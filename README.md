##btl-route: Bootstrap-Tabs-Live-Route

A tabbed routing engine for AngularJS/ Bootstrap3

Avoids the context switch inherent in ng-route, instead all the tabs are loaded into the DOM ('live'), and hidden / shown depending on which is selected.  

Also reads from and writes to the location bar.
